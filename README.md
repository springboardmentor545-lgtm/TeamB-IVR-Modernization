# TeamB-IVR-Modernization
## Documentation

The following section explains how different parts of the IVR system interact with each other.  
We use a **sequence diagram** to show the step-by-step flow of communication between:  

- **User** → the person making the call  
- **IVR** → the Interactive Voice Response system that takes input  
- **Middleware** → the layer that processes and forwards requests  
- **Backend** → the system that provides data and final responses  

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant IVR
    participant Middleware
    participant Backend

    User->>IVR: Call and press a key (e.g., 1 for Balance)
    IVR->>Middleware: Send input
    Middleware->>Backend: Request account balance
    Backend-->>Middleware: Return balance details
    Middleware-->>IVR: Send processed balance info
    IVR-->>User: Play balance response

    alt Invalid Input
        IVR-->>User: Play error message (Invalid option)
        IVR-->>User: Ask to re-enter input
    end

```

### Explanation
The sequence diagram shows how the IVR system works:
1. The **User** calls and gives input to the **IVR**.
2. The **IVR** sends the input to the **Middleware**.
3. The **Middleware** processes the request by contacting the **Backend**.
4. The **Backend** sends back the response to the **Middleware**.
5. The **Middleware** returns the processed information to the **IVR**.
6. Finally, the **IVR** provides the response back to the **User**.

This flow ensures smooth communication between the user and backend through the IVR system.
